The Quicklisp Controller is responsible for building and updating
Quicklisp distributions from a project list (maintained separately in
the quicklisp-projects repo).

It fetches project source from a variety of places: git, cvs, svn,
http-available tarballs, etc, and uses that to build up metadata about
the relationships between projects. New or updated projects are then
uploaded into the quicklisp download space.

You must create ~/quicklisp-controller/ and symlink a checkout of
quicklisp-projects (or something with similar directory structure) to
~/quicklisp-controller/projects. A quick way to do that:

  (setup-directories "~/path/to/quicklisp-projects/")

To fetch/update all project sources, use:

  (update-what-you-can)

To build everything that can be built, use:

  (ensure-what-wins-you-can)

To combine those two operations, concluding with a report of what
differs from the last Quicklisp dist:

  (recrank)
